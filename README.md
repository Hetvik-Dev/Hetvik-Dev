### 📈 The "Green Flags" (Consistency)
**Talk is cheap. Results are public.**
Over the last 6+ months, I have been architecting the foundation of **StrawHat Apps** day by day. This calendar visualizes the consistent transition from "Idea" to "Organization" starting mid-year.

### 🧬 The "StrawHat" Stack
I operate as a full-cycle development department. I handle the entire pipeline: **Design ➔ Code ➔ Database ➔ Deployment.**
